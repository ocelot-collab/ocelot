Accelerator, radiation and x-ray optics simulation framework

# An Introduction to Ocelot

Ocelot is a multiphysics simulation toolkit designed for studying FEL and storage ring-based light sources. Ocelot is written in Python. Its central concept is the writing of python's scripts for simulations with the usage of Ocelot's modules and functions and the standard Python libraries.

Ocelot includes following main modules:
* **Charged particle beam dynamics module (CPBD)**
    - optics
    - tracking
    - matching
    - collective effects (description can be found [here](http://vrws.de/ipac2017/papers/wepab031.pdf) and [here](https://journals.aps.org/prab/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.22.024401))
        - Space Charge (3D Laplace solver)
        - CSR (Coherent Synchrotron Radiation) (1D model with arbitrary number of dipoles).
        - Wakefields (Taylor expansion up to second order for arbitrary geometry).
    - MOGA (Multi Objective Genetics Algorithm) [ref](http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ipac2016/papers/thpmb034.pdf).
* **Native module for spontaneous radiation calculation** (some details can be found [here](http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ipac2019/papers/wepts017.pdf) and [here](http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S1600577519002509))
* **FEL calculations: interface to GENESIS and pre/post-processing**
* **Modules for online beam control and online optimization of accelerator performances.**   [ref1](http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/IPAC2014/papers/mopro086.pdf), [ref2](https://jacowfs.jlab.org/conf/y15/ipac15/prepress/TUPWA037.PDF), [ref3](http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ipac2016/papers/wepoy036.pdf), [ref4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02335.pdf).
    - This module is being developed in collaboration with other accelerator groups. The module has been migrated to a separate [repository](https://github.com/ocelot-collab/optimizer) (in [ocelot-collab](https://github.com/ocelot-collab) organization) for ease of collaborative development.

Ocelot extensively  uses Python's [NumPy (Numerical Python)](http://numpy.org) and [SciPy (Scientific Python)](http://scipy.org) libraries, which enable efficient in-core numerical and scientific computation within Python and give you access to various mathematical and optimization techniques and algorithms. To produce high quality figures Python's [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html) library is used.

It is an open source project and it is being developed by physicists from  [The European XFEL](http://www.xfel.eu/), [DESY](http://www.desy.de/) (Germany), [NRC Kurchatov Institute](http://www.nrcki.ru/) (Russia).

We still have no documentation but you can find a lot of examples in /demos/ folder including this tutorial

## Ocelot user profile

Ocelot is designed for researchers who want to have the flexibility that is given by high-level languages such as Matlab, Python (with Numpy and SciPy) or Mathematica.
However if someone needs a GUI  it can be developed using Python's libraries like a [PyQtGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) or [PyQt](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/).
 

 ## Preliminaries

The tutorial includes 7 simple examples dediacted to beam dynamics and optics. However, you should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of Python language is a plus.

##### This tutorial requires the following packages:

- Python 3.5-3.7 (python 2.7 can work as well but not guaranteed)
- `numpy` version 1.8 or later: http://www.numpy.org/
- `scipy` version 0.15 or later: http://www.scipy.org/
- `matplotlib` version 1.5 or later: http://matplotlib.org/
- `ipython` version 2.4 or later, with notebook support: http://ipython.org

**Optional**, but highly recommended for speeding up calculations
- numexpr (version 2.6.1)
- pyfftw (version 0.10)
- numba

**Orbit Correction module**
- pandas

The easiest way to get these is to download and install the (large) [Anaconda software distribution](https://www.continuum.io/).

Alternatively, you can download and install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
The following command will install all required packages:
```
$ conda install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Ocelot installation
##### Anaconda Cloud **recommended**
The easiest way to install OCELOT is to use Anaconda cloud. In that case use command:
 ```
 $ conda install -c ocelot-collab ocelot
 ``` 
##### GitHub
Clone OCELOT from GitHub:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ocelot-collab/ocelot.git
```
or download last release [zip file](https://github.com/ocelot-collab/ocelot/archive/v18.02.0.zip).
Now you can install OCELOT from the source:
```
$ python setup.py install
```

##### PythonPath
Another way is download ocelot from [GitHub](https://github.com/ocelot-collab/ocelot)
1. you have to download from GitHub [zip file](https://github.com/ocelot-collab/ocelot/archive/master.zip).
2. Unzip ocelot-master.zip to your working folder **/your_working_dir/**.
3. Add **../your_working_dir/ocelot-master** to PYTHONPATH
    - **Windows 7:** go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advance System Settings -> Environment Variables.
    and in User variables add **/your_working_dir/ocelot-master/** to PYTHONPATH. If variable PYTHONPATH does not exist, create it

    Variable name: PYTHONPATH

    Variable value: ../your_working_dir/ocelot-master/
    - Linux:
    ```
    $ export PYTHONPATH=/your_working_dir/ocelot-master:$PYTHONPATH
    ```

#### To launch "ipython notebook" or "jupyter notebook"
in command line run following commands:

```
$ ipython notebook
```

or
```
$ ipython notebook --notebook-dir="path_to_your_directory"
```

or
```
$ jupyter notebook --notebook-dir="path_to_your_directory"

## Documentation
The API documentation can be build using [sphinx](https://sphinx.org).
To do so, you have to clone the repository or download the zip file, as explained in the [ocelot installation section](#ocelot-installation).
Then you can install all dependencies by running
``` bash
python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```
Now you can build the documentation by running
```
python setup.py build_sphinx
```
If these steps succeeded (yes, there are still very many errors and warnings during building the documentation),
you can browse the HTML documentation by opening `build/sphinx/html/index.html` in your browser.
