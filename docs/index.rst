OCELOT Documentation
====================

Overview
--------
OCELOT is a framework for synchrotron light source and FEL design and operation.


Ocelot is a multiphysics simulation toolkit designed for studying FEL and storage ring based light sources.
Ocelot is written in Python. Its central concept is the writing of Python's scripts for simulations with the usage of
Ocelot's modules and functions and the standard Python libraries.

Ocelot includes following main modules:

* **Charged particle beam dynamics module (CPBD)**
    - optics
    - tracking
    - matching
    - collective effects
        - Space Charge (true 3D Laplace solver)
        - CSR (Coherent Synchrotron Radiation) (1D model with arbitrary number of dipoles) (under development).
        - Wakefields (Taylor expansion up to second order for arbitrary geometry).
    - MOGA (Multi Objective Genetics Algorithm). (under development but we have already applied it for a storage ring `application <http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ipac2016/papers/thpmb034.pdf>`_
* **Native module for spontaneous radiation calculation**
* **FEL calculations: interface to GENESIS and pre/post-processing**
* **Modules for online beam control and online optimization of accelerator performances.** `Work1 <http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/IPAC2014/papers/mopro086.pdf>`_ , `work2 <https://jacowfs.jlab.org/conf/y15/ipac15/prepress/TUPWA037.PDF>`_ , `work3 <http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ipac2016/papers/wepoy036.pdf>`_ .

Ocelot extensively uses Python's `NumPy (Numerical Python <http://numpy.org>`_ and `SciPy (Scientific Python) <http://scipy.org>`_ libraries,
which enable efficient in-core numerical and scientific computation within Python and give you access to various mathematical and optimization techniques and algorithms.
To produce high quality figures Python's `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/index.html>`_ library is used.

It is an open source project and it is being developed by physicists from  `The European XFEL <http://www.xfel.eu/>`_ , `DESY <http://www.desy.de/>`_ (Germany), `NRC Kurchatov Institute <http://www.nrcki.ru/>`_ (Russia).


* **Ocelot user profile**


Ocelot is designed for researchers who want to have the flexibility that is given by high-level languages such as Matlab, Python (with Numpy and SciPy) or Mathematica.
However if someone needs a GUI  it can be developed using Python's libraries like a `PyQtGraph <http://www.pyqtgraph.org/>`_ or `PyQt <http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/>`_ .

Installation:
-------------

You can install it via pip in your terminal

.. code-block:: bash
        
        python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ocelot-collab/ocelot.git@v19.12.0

Where you might have to update the version (here *v19.12.0*) to the release you want to install.

Alternatively, you can download the zip file from GitHub.

Unzip ocelot-master.zip to your working folder ``../your_working_dir/``.

Rename folder ``../your_working_dir/ocelot-master`` to ``../your_working_dir/ocelot``.
Add ``../your_working_dir/`` to *PYTHONPATH*

**Windows 7**: go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advance System Settings -> Environment Variables. and in User variables add ``../your_working_dir/`` to *PYTHONPATH*. If variable *PYTHONPATH* does not exist, create it.

Variable name: ``PYTHONPATH``

Variable value: ``../your_working_dir/``

**Linux**:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export PYTHONPATH=**../your_working_dir/**:$PYTHONPATH
